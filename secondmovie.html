		<h1>PACIFIC RIM</h1>
		<hr>
		<li> In 2013, massive alien monsters called Kaiju begin emerging from an interdimensional portal,
		"the Breach" at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean and attacking coastal cities. In response,
		humanity builds massive robots called Jaegers,
		each co-piloted by two or more people who share a mental link by a process called "Drifting" to share the mental stress of piloting the machine.</li>
		<li> Pacific rim is all about humanity's stand against other wordly beings</li>
		<li> A perfect portrayal of human brotherhood, unity and the constant of fighting for peace</li>
		<li> If you need a movie to binge watch for motivation The Pacific Rim and its other sequels should be on your list.</li>
